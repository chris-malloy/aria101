    <!-- View Accessibility Tree object through properties in the inspector -->

    <!-- Standard Web Control -->
    <!-- You can see that the Role is that of "check box" (44), that the Name is that of "Delete browsing history on exit", and that
    the State when focused and checked is that of "FOCUSED CHECKED FOCUSABLE" (1048596 in IE11). The Accessibility Tree object
    Role, Name, and State values on the web Checkbox match the software Checkbox control in the Operating System. -->
    <input type="checkbox" checked title="Delete browsing history on exit" />

    <!-- Simulated Web Controls using ARIA -->

    <!-- Example 1. w/o aria -->
    <!-- You can see that the Role is that of "grouping" (20), that the Name is that of "Delete browsing history on exit", and that
    the State when focused is that of "FOCUSED FOCUSABLE" (1048580 in IE11). In essence, this is a standard SPAN element that
    has been made focusable using tabindex, and includes a Title attribute, but is nothing more in the Accessibility Tree. There
    is no mapping to a Checkbox control type with relevant State information on the Operating System. -->
    <span tabindex="0" title="Delete browsing history on exit" class="checked" style="display:block;width:20px;height:20px;background-color:red;"></span>
    
    <!-- spacer -->
    <div style="height: 10px"></div>

    <!-- Example 2. w/ aria -->
    <!-- Now, you can see that the Role is that of "check box" (44), that the Name is that of "Delete browsing history on exit",
    and that the State when focused and checked is that of "FOCUSED CHECKED FOCUSABLE" (1048596 in IE11). The simulated Checkbox
    control has now been mapped to its software equivalent on the Operating System, which makes it possible for Assistive Technologies
    like screen readers to convey it properly by accessing supporting states and properties such as the "check box" role, the
    current CHECKED state, and the accessible name. -->
    <span tabindex="0" role="checkbox" aria-checked="true" title="Delete browsing history on exit" class="checked" style="display:block;width:20px;height:20px;background-color:red;"></span>
