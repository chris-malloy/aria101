# Aria 101

## Description
Introduction in Aria concepts and usage.

## Primary Documents
##### There are three primary documents that dictate how ARIA works and should be applied by developers.

## Notes
Aria, or Accessible Rich Internet Applications, is is a set of attributes that define ways to make Web content and Web applications (especially those developed with Ajax, JavaScript and more recent web technologies like Bootstrap) more accessible to people with disabilities. For example, ARIA enables accessible navigation landmarks, JavaScript widgets, form hints and error messages, live content updates, and more.

When ARIA is implemented correctly, you can literally change the nature of a custom web component in order to maximize accessibility for Assistive Technology users.
